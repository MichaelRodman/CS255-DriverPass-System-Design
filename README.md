## Module 8 Journal Reflection

### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass was the client for this course project. They wanted a web-based system to help students prepare for their driving test by offering practice exams and scheduling behind-the-wheel driving lessons. The system also needed features for admins and staff to manage users, lesson availability, and business operations.

### What did you do particularly well?
I did well translating the written requirements into clear design artifacts. My UML diagrams helped break down user interactions and show how key workflows (like scheduling) should work. I also focused on keeping my documents organized and easy to follow so a development team could use them during implementation.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could revise one part, I would add more detail around edge cases and exception handling (for example: scheduling conflicts, payment failures, or invalid account states). I would also include clearer guidance on what the user sees when something goes wrong. This would reduce confusion during implementation and make the system easier to maintain.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I started by identifying the main user groups (students/customers, instructors, and admins) and what each group needed to accomplish. I used those needs to define the core requirements, then modeled them with UML diagrams and system design details. Considering user needs is important because a system can be technically correct but still fail if it doesn’t match what users expect or if it’s confusing to use.

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach design by starting with the problem and user goals, then moving into requirements, diagrams/models, and finally the technical details. In the future, I would continue using strategies like turning requirements into use cases, using activity/sequence diagrams to confirm workflows, and reviewing edge cases early. I also want to keep improving how I document decisions so the system is easier for other developers (and my future self) to understand.
